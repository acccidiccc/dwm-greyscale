	2 cd into the newly created directory.
	3 make sure that you have root access/sudo/doas and then execute the command "sudo make clean install". this will install dwm with this config. 
	4 add this to your .xinitrc file "exec dwm". i am sure that i didnt explain it very good, so i'll include my .xinitrc file. it is an almost copy of mental outlaw's 
	  one, but with minor changes. all credit for it goes to him.
	5 if youre already in a graphical enviroment, exit out of it into the tty and type in startx. thats how  i start dwm. i am very sure theyre better ways to install 
     so dont do everything i say
